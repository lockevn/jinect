# webcam-kinect

Kinect is discontinued by Microsoft.

But I want to make it usable, to use hand motion to control the browser.
This repo is and experimental built 7 years ago in a Hackday when I was at Episerver.
It works. If I have some freetime at the moment (2021), I will make a better verion with modern technology (to make the code shorter and more elegant).

Use Kinect with browser, connect by JS. Use face.com API to detect mood. More info about useful lib http://neave.com/webcam/html5/ http://www.raymondcamden.com/index.cfm/2012/4/6/Face-detection-with-getUserMedia  Face recognition http://api.lambdal.com/docs/start
