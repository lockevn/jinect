<!--You need a simple video tag to receive the user’s webcam feed. 
            Don’t forget to set the autoplay property. 
            Without it, the stream pauses on the first frame received.

            The video tag will actually not be displayed. 
            Its css display style is set to none. 
            Instead, draw the stream received in a canvas so I can use it for the motion detection. 
            Create the canvas to draw the webcam stream:
            -->
<video id="webcam" autoplay width="640" height="480"></video>

<!--original video from webcam-->
<canvas id="canvasSource" width="640" height="480"></canvas>
